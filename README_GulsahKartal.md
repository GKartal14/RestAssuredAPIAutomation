API Test Automation using Rest Assured and Java

In this project, I created 4 different API test cases, three of which are for CRUD operations and one of which is for delayed response validation. I created a Maven project and dowloaded the necessary dependencies including Rest Assured, TestNG, JSON. 

In my test cases, methods address HTTP requests and I also wrote the response on JSON file as output, which is automatically generated after the completion of test execution. I also outputted the HTTP status code after the completion of requests. For POST requests, status code should be 201; for PUT request, status code should be 200; for DELETE request, status code should be 204 after test executions. 

The test cases are under src/test/java path, you can find the Maven project which are created for these test cases.

Tech stack: Eclipse IDE, Java, Rest Assured, TestNG, JSON, Git.
